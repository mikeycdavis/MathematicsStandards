/**
 * Adapter-contract fidelity, against an external target.
 *
 * standards-adapter.json declares how this pack is invoked by StandardsEnforcer. A declaration that
 * drifts from the CLI it describes is worse than no declaration: the enforcer would run something,
 * get JSON back, and report a verdict for a question nobody asked. This pack has an `audit` subcommand that discovers evidence and produces no verdict, so a
 * declaration naming the wrong one is not hypothetical.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS TEST ESTABLISHED, AND WHAT IT DID NOT. It compared the contract
 * against a `DIRECT` constant declared a few lines above it, and it evaluated the standards
 * repository itself. Both were weaker than they read:
 *
 *   - A constant edited in the same commit as the contract is not an independent oracle. It catches
 *     the JSON changing without the test changing, and cannot catch both being wrong together.
 *   - With target == ROOT, the one configuration the adapter exists for — a standards checkout that
 *     is not the thing being evaluated — was never exercised. An evaluator that ignored its target
 *     and graded its own tree would have passed.
 *
 * SO THIS VERSION ASSERTS THREE THINGS THE OLD ONE COULD NOT:
 *
 *   1. TARGET IDENTITY — the result carries evidence attributable to the external target, not merely
 *      the same JSON from two commands.
 *   2. INVOCATION INDEPENDENCE — the direct oracle's subcommand is read from README.md at run time.
 *      Editing standards-adapter.json cannot move it.
 *   3. CROSS-CHECKOUT — pointed at ROOT instead of the target, the run produces a different result.
 *      That is the mutation: if it did not differ, this file would be proving nothing about targets.
 *
 * None of this changes what the contract says. It changes what this pack can honestly claim to have
 * checked about it.
