/**
 * Adapter-contract fidelity.
 *
 * standards-adapter.json declares how this pack is invoked by StandardsEnforcer. A declaration that
 * drifts from the CLI it describes is worse than no declaration: the enforcer would run something,
 * get JSON back, and report a verdict for a question nobody asked. Betting and Innovation both have a `check`
 * subcommand that answers something other than their verdict, so that is not hypothetical.
 *
 * This test is the pack keeping its own promise. It builds the argv from the contract, runs it, runs
 * the documented invocation directly, and requires the two results to be identical.
